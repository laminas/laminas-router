Typically, routing will examine the request URI, and attempt to match the URI path segment against provided constraints. If the constraints match, a set of \"matches\" are returned, one of which should be the controller name to execute. Routing can utilize other portions of the request URI or environment as well. For example, the host or scheme, query parameters, headers, request method, and more. The base unit of routing is a Route : namespace Laminas\\Router; use Laminas\\Stdlib\\RequestInterface as Request; interface RouteInterface { public static function factory(array $options = []); public function match(Request $request); public function assemble(array $params = [], array $options = []); } A Route accepts a Request , and determines if it matches. If so, it returns a RouteMatch object: namespace Laminas\\Router; class RouteMatch { public function __construct(array $params); public function setMatchedRouteName($name); public function getMatchedRouteName(); public function setParam($name, $value); public function getParams(); public function getParam($name, $default = null); } Typically, when a Route matches, it will define one or more parameters. These are passed into the RouteMatch , and objects may query the RouteMatch for their values. $id = $routeMatch-&gt;getParam('id', false); if (! $id) { throw new Exception('Required identifier is missing!'); } $entity = $resource-&gt;get($id); Usually you will have multiple routes you wish to test against. In order to facilitate this, you will use a route aggregate, usually implementing RouteStack : namespace Laminas\\Router; interface RouteStackInterface extends RouteInterface { public function addRoute($name, $route, $priority = null); public function addRoutes(array $routes); public function removeRoute($name); public function setRoutes(array $routes); } Routes will be queried in a LIFO order, and hence the reason behind the name RouteStack . laminas-router provides two implementations of this interface, SimpleRouteStack and TreeRouteStack . In each, you register routes either one at a time using addRoute() , or in bulk using addRoutes() . // One at a time: $route = Literal::factory([ 'route' =&gt; '/foo', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'foo-index', 'action' =&gt; 'index', ], ]); $router-&gt;addRoute('foo', $route); // In bulk: $router-&gt;addRoutes([ // using already instantiated routes: 'foo' =&gt; $route, // providing configuration to allow lazy-loading routes: 'bar' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'literal', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/bar', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'bar-index', 'action' =&gt; 'index', ], ], ], ]); Router Types Two routers are provided, the SimpleRouteStack and TreeRouteStack . Each works with the above interface, but utilize slightly different options and execution paths. By default, the laminas-router uses the TreeRouteStack as the router. SimpleRouteStack This router takes individual routes that provide their full matching logic in one go, and loops through them in LIFO order until a match is found. As such, routes that will match most often should be registered last, and least common routes first. Additionally, you will need to ensure that routes that potentially overlap are registered such that the most specific match will match first (i.e., register later). Alternatively, you can set priorities by giving the priority as third parameter to the addRoute() method, specifying the priority in the route specifications or setting the priority property within a route instance before adding it to the route stack. TreeRouteStack Laminas\\Router\\Http\\TreeRouteStack provides the ability to register trees of routes, and uses a B-tree algorithm to match routes. As such, you register a single route with many children. A TreeRouteStack will consist of the following configuration: A base \"route\", which describes the base match needed, the root of the tree. An optional route_plugins , which is a configured Laminas\\Router\\RoutePluginManager that can lazy-load routes. The option may_terminate , which hints to the router that no other segments will follow it. An optional child_routes array, which contains additional routes that stem from the base \"route\" (i.e., build from it). Each child route can itself be a TreeRouteStack if desired; in fact, the Part route works exactly this way. When a route matches against a TreeRouteStack , the matched parameters from each segment of the tree will be returned. A TreeRouteStack can be your sole route for your application, or describe particular path segments of the application. An example of a TreeRouteStack is provided in the documentation of the Part route. HTTP Route Types laminas-router ships with the following HTTP route types. Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Hostname The Hostname route attempts to match the hostname registered in the request against specific criteria. Typically, this will be in one of the following forms: subdomain.domain.tld :subdomain.domain.tld In the above, the second route would return a \"subdomain\" key as part of the route match. For any given hostname segment, you may also provide a constraint. As an example, if the \"subdomain\" segment needed to match only if it started with \"fw\" and contained exactly 2 digits following, the following route would be needed: $route = Hostname::factory([ 'route' =&gt; ':subdomain.domain.tld', 'constraints' =&gt; [ 'subdomain' =&gt; 'fw\\d{2}', ], ]); In the above example, only a \"subdomain\" key will be returned in the RouteMatch . If you wanted to also provide other information based on matching, or a default value to return for the subdomain, you need to also provide defaults. $route = Hostname::factory([ 'route' =&gt; ':subdomain.domain.tld', 'constraints' =&gt; [ 'subdomain' =&gt; 'fw\\d{2}', ], 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'json', ], ]); When matched, the above will return two keys in the RouteMatch , \"subdomain\" and \"type\". Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Literal The Literal route is for doing exact matching of the URI path. Configuration therefore is solely the path you want to match, and the \"defaults\", or parameters you want returned on a match. $route = Literal::factory([ 'route' =&gt; '/foo', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'Application\\Controller\\IndexController', 'action' =&gt; 'foo', ], ]); The above route would match a path \"/foo\", and return the key \"action\" in the RouteMatch , with the value \"foo\". Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Method The Method route is used to match the HTTP method or 'verb' specified in the request (See RFC 2616 Sec. 5.1.1). It can optionally be configured to match against multiple methods by providing a comma-separated list of method tokens. $route = Method::factory([ 'verb' =&gt; 'post,put', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'Application\\Controller\\IndexController', 'action' =&gt; 'form-submit', ], ]); The above route would match an http \"POST\" or \"PUT\" request and return a RouteMatch object containing a key \"action\" with a value of \"form-submit\". Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Part A Part route allows crafting a tree of possible routes based on segments of the URI path. It actually extends the TreeRouteStack . Part routes are difficult to describe, so we'll simply provide a sample one here. $route = Part::factory([ 'route' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'literal', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'Application\\Controller\\IndexController', 'action' =&gt; 'index', ], ], ], 'route_plugins' =&gt; $routePlugins, 'may_terminate' =&gt; true, 'child_routes' =&gt; [ 'blog' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'literal', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/blog', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'Application\\Controller\\BlogController', 'action' =&gt; 'index', ], ], 'may_terminate' =&gt; true, 'child_routes' =&gt; [ 'rss' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'literal', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/rss', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'action' =&gt; 'rss', ] ], 'may_terminate' =&gt; true, 'child_routes' =&gt; [ 'subrss' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'literal', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/sub', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'action' =&gt; 'subrss', ], ], ], ], ], ], ], 'forum' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'literal', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; 'forum', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'Application\\Controller\\ForumController', 'action' =&gt; 'index', ], ], ], ], ]); The above would match the following: / would load the \"Index\" controller, \"index\" action. /blog would load the \"Blog\" controller, \"index\" action. /blog/rss would load the \"Blog\" controller, \"rss\" action. /blog/rss/sub would load the \"Blog\" controller, \"subrss\" action. /forum would load the \"Forum\" controller, \"index\" action. You may use any route type as a child route of a Part route. Part routes are an implementation detail Part routes are not meant to be used directly. When you add definitions for child_routes to any route type, that route will become a Part route. As already said, describing Part routes with words is difficult, so hopefully the additional examples at the end will provide further insight. Route plugins In the above example, the $routePlugins is an instance of Laminas\\Router\\RoutePluginManager , containing essentially the following configuration: $routePlugins = new Laminas\\Router\\RoutePluginManager(); $plugins = [ 'hostname' =&gt; 'Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Hostname', 'literal' =&gt; 'Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Literal', 'part' =&gt; 'Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Part', 'regex' =&gt; 'Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Regex', 'scheme' =&gt; 'Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Scheme', 'segment' =&gt; 'Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Segment', 'wildcard' =&gt; 'Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Wildcard', 'method' =&gt; 'Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Method', ]; foreach ($plugins as $name =&gt; $class) { $routePlugins-&gt;setInvokableClass($name, $class); } When using Laminas\\Router\\Http\\TreeRouteStack , the RoutePluginManager is set up by default, and the developer does not need to worry about autoloading of standard HTTP routes. Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Placeholder Since 3.2.0 A Placeholder route is provided for use by reusable modules. The idea is that a module can provide a set of routes anchored by a placeholder route type. The end consumer can replace this placeholder route with a different route type of their choosing to customise how the module's routes act within the application as a whole, without needing to alter either the route configuration of the module or the URL building contained within the module. As an example, consider a reusable user module which provides routing configuration for login and registration pages. A consumer of this module may want the auth module to live either: 1) At the root of their domain. 2) Under a path, e.g. /auth/ . 3) On a separate subdomain, e.g. auth.mydomain.com . The module can provide configuration such as the following: return [ 'auth' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; \\Laminas\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Placeholder::class, 'child_routes' =&gt; [ 'login' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; \\Laminas\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Literal::class, 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/login', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; AuthController::class, 'action' =&gt; 'login' ], ], ], 'register' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; \\Laminas\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Literal::class, 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/register', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; RegistrationController::class, 'action' =&gt; 'register' ], ], ], ], ], ]; The consuming application can then leave this configuration as is to have the auth module sit at the route of their domain. If they wish to change the resource location, they can provide an alternative route type to replace the Placeholder route as part of their own router configuration. As an example: return [ 'auth' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; \\Laminas\\Mvc\\Router\\Http\\Literal::class, 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/auth', ], ], ]; In the above, the top-level route type changes from Placeholder to Literal , and the routes will now match against /auth/login and /auth/register . Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Regex A Regex route utilizes a regular expression to match against the URI path. Any valid regular expression is allowed; our recommendation is to use named captures for any values you want to return in the RouteMatch . Since regular expression routes are often complex, you must specify a \"spec\" or specification to use when assembling URLs from regex routes. The spec is simply a string; replacements are identified using %keyname% within the string, with the keys coming from either the captured values or named parameters passed to the assemble() method. Just like other routes, the Regex route can accept \"defaults\", parameters to include in the RouteMatch when successfully matched. $route = Regex::factory([ 'regex' =&gt; '/blog/(?&lt;id&gt;[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)(\\.(?&lt;format&gt;(json|html|xml|rss)))?', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'Application\\Controller\\BlogController', 'action' =&gt; 'view', 'format' =&gt; 'html', ], 'spec' =&gt; '/blog/%id%.%format%', ]); The above would match /blog/001-some-blog_slug-here.html , and return four items in the RouteMatch , an \"id\", the \"controller\", the \"action\", and the \"format\". When assembling a URL from this route, the \"id\" and \"format\" values would be used to fill the specification. Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Scheme The Scheme route matches the URI scheme only, and must be an exact match. As such, this route, like the Literal route, simply takes what you want to match and the \"defaults\", parameters to return on a match. $route = Scheme::factory([ 'scheme' =&gt; 'https', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'https' =&gt; true, ], ]); The above route would match the \"https\" scheme, and return the key \"https\" in the RouteMatch with a boolean true value. Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Segment A Segment route allows matching any segment of a URI path. Segments are denoted using a colon, followed by alphanumeric characters; if a segment is optional, it should be surrounded by brackets. As an example, /:foo[/:bar] would match a / followed by text and assign it to the key \"foo\"; if any additional / characters are found, any text following the last one will be assigned to the key \"bar\". The separation between literal and named segments can be anything. For example, the above could be done as /:foo{-}[-:bar] as well. The {-} after the :foo parameter indicates a set of one or more delimiters, after which matching of the parameter itself ends. Each segment may have constraints associated with it. Each constraint should simply be a regular expression expressing the conditions under which that segment should match. Also, as you can in other routes, you may provide defaults to use; these are particularly useful when using optional segments. As a complex example: $route = Segment::factory([ 'route' =&gt; '/:controller[/:action]', 'constraints' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]+', 'action' =&gt; '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]+', ], 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'Application\\Controller\\IndexController', 'action' =&gt; 'index', ], ]); Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Wildcard (Deprecated) Potential security issue Misuse of this route type can lead to potential security issues. Deprecated This route type is deprecated. Use the Segment route type. The Wildcard route type matches all remaining segments of a URI path. HTTP Routing Examples Most of the routing definitions will be done in module configuration files, so the following examples will show how to set up routes in config files. Simple example with two literal routes return [ 'router' =&gt; [ 'routes' =&gt; [ // Literal route named \"home\" 'home' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'literal', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'Application\\Controller\\IndexController', 'action' =&gt; 'index', ], ], ], // Literal route named \"contact\" 'contact' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'literal', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; 'contact', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'Application\\Controller\\ContactController', 'action' =&gt; 'form', ], ], ], ], ], ]; A complex example with child routes return [ 'router' =&gt; [ 'routes' =&gt; [ // Literal route named \"home\" 'home' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'literal', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'Application\\Controller\\IndexController', 'action' =&gt; 'index', ], ], ], // Literal route named \"blog\", with child routes 'blog' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'literal', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/blog', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'Application\\Controller\\BlogController', 'action' =&gt; 'index', ], ], 'may_terminate' =&gt; true, 'child_routes' =&gt; [ // Segment route for viewing one blog post 'post' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'segment', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/[:slug]', 'constraints' =&gt; [ 'slug' =&gt; '[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+', ], 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'action' =&gt; 'view', ], ], ], // Literal route for viewing blog RSS feed 'rss' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'literal', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/rss', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'action' =&gt; 'rss', ], ], ], ], ], ], ], ]; When using child routes, naming of the routes follows the parent/child pattern, so to use the child routes from the above example: echo $this-&gt;url('blog'); // gives \"/blog\" echo $this-&gt;url('blog/post', ['slug' =&gt; 'my-post']); // gives \"/blog/my-post\" echo $this-&gt;url('blog/rss'); // gives \"/blog/rss\" An example with multiple Hostnames and subdomains within a single application return [ 'router' =&gt; [ 'routes' =&gt; [ 'modules.laminas.dev' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Hostname', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; ':4th.[:3rd.]:2nd.:1st', // domain levels from right to left 'constraints' =&gt; [ '4th' =&gt; 'modules', '3rd' =&gt; '.*?', // optional 3rd level domain such as .ci, .dev or .test '2nd' =&gt; 'laminas', '1st' =&gt; 'com', ], // Purposely omit default controller and action // to let the child routes control the route match ], // child route controllers may span multiple modules as desired 'child_routes' =&gt; [ 'index' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Literal', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'Module\\Controller\\Index', 'action' =&gt; 'index', ], ], 'may_terminate' =&gt; true, ], ], ], 'packages.laminas.dev' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Hostname', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; ':4th.[:3rd.]:2nd.:1st', // domain levels from right to left 'constraints' =&gt; [ '4th' =&gt; 'packages', '3rd' =&gt; '.*?', // optional 3rd level domain such as .ci, .dev or .test '2nd' =&gt; 'laminas', '1st' =&gt; 'com', ], // Purposely omit default controller and action // to let the child routes control the route match ], // child route controllers may span multiple modules as desired 'child_routes' =&gt; [ 'index' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'Laminas\\Router\\Http\\Literal', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/', 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'Package\\Controller\\Index', 'action' =&gt; 'index', ], ], 'may_terminate' =&gt; true, ], ], ], ], ], ]; The above would match the following: modules.laminas.dev would dispatch the Index controller's index action of the Module module. modules.ci.laminas.dev would dispatch the Index controller's index action of the Module module. packages.laminas.dev would dispatch the Index controller's index action of the Package module. packages.dev.laminas.dev would dispatch the Index controller's index action of the Package module. The Url controller plugin or view helper may be used to generate URLs following the above example: // reuse the route matched parameters to generate URLs echo $this-&gt;url('modules.laminas.dev/index', [], [], true); echo $this-&gt;url('packages.laminas.dev/index', [], [], true); may_terminate and child_routes placement When defining child routes pay attention that the may_terminate and child_routes definitions are in same level as the options and type definitions. A common pitfall is to have those two definitions nested in options , which will not result in the desired routes.","title":"Routing"},{"location":"routing/#routing","text":"Routing is the act of matching a request to a given controller.
